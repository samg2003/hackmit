# Sea Elevation Forecast
### Submission for HackMIT 2021
---
Sea Elevation Forecast is a tool that will allow users to see how many years it would take for their favourite coastal locations to be underwater because of the rising sea levels that global warming is causing. The idea is that by getting a concrete and looming ‘doomsday’ of when global warming will directly affect each individual, the gravity of the situation will be clearer and we can influence more people to take action on it. That’s why the ‘doomsday’ date is in bright red on a minimalistic background, and immediately followed by a link people can use to learn more about the situation.
We used the GMSL dataset, the global mean sea level for the past 30 years, and vector autoregression to predict when it would rise over the given coordinate elevation. Please visit our site at [https://wateruprise.herokuapp.com]https://wateruprise.herokuapp.com.

This project was created by Sambhav Gupta and Liza George for HackMIT 2021. We're both freshmen studying Computer Science at UIUC and relatively new to hackathons. We're so grateful for this opportunity to test our technical and teamworking skills!
